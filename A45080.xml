            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat all Money may be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently reſpected as a Metall, and as a Coin. As a Metall 'tis ſerviceable to many other good purpoſes, and being rated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, it would not riſe in price much above other Metalls. As a Coin, 'tis no more then a Counter. Yet, as the matter now goes, that is it which now raiſes it in value infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above all other Metalls in the world; and we Annually part with great quantities of our beſt Staple Commodities, to the value of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds worth, to purchaſe ſo much of the aforeſaid Metalls, as would ſupply our want of Money; which, as was ſaid, are nothing elſe but certain Authoriſed Coins or Medals, that like Tokens of Account are ſure upon every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Commodities to yield their Impreſſed value, ſerving onely to ſupply the interval of time between the ſelling of one Commodity, and the buying of another: Which Credit, grounded on good Security, can as well perform, by transferring the ſame from one to another, as the Ownerſhip of Money in Foreign Banks, for that is by many accepted, and often preferred before Money, is that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66157:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 17 -->onely, not uſe, that will both attract and command it to any place or perſon whatſoever. Nor is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo to be thought the life of Trade, as though it could not ſubſiſt without it, ſeeing 'tis well known there hath been very great Trading by way of Commutation, or Barter, when there was but little Money ſtirring in the world. The <hi>Dutch, Italians, &amp;c.</hi> have ſuch remedies againſt this want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade; becauſe they commonly tranſport Bills of Debt, and have both Publick and Private Banks, wherein they aſſign their reſpective Credits daily, for very great Sums, and that with great eaſe and ſatisfaction, by Writings onely; whilſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, that maſs of Treaſure, giving foundation to the aforeſaid Credit, is employed in Forreign Trade and Merchandiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by thoſe means they have little other uſe of Money, more then for their ordinary Expences.</p>
            <p>The benefit or grand effect of the aforeſaid Banks, whether Publick or Private, are ſufficiently known, though not ſo well underſtood at firſt; and were introduc'd into the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> by a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edict or Placaet of the State, requiring all Payments, exceeding ſuch a Sum, to be made at one place; which being fairly Regiſtred, and put to each mans Account, the Bank, in nature of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, becomes of courſe a Witneſs to all Receipts and Payments made there: Avoiding thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny litigious Diſputes in Law, which uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in other Countreys, to the great obſtruction of Commerce.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66157:3"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 17 -->
            <p>And although every man might indifferently carry off his Money <hi>in Specie</hi> to his own houſe, or have it placed on his account; yet foraſmuch as by Law, all were obliged to pay it there, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they had occaſion to iſſue it out again, they choſe rather to paſs over their reſpective Credits by way of Aſsignation, which came in a continual ſuit to a hundred; by means whereof, an hundred pound was ſufficient to anſwer the Credit of an hundred times as much in Bank.</p>
            <p>That this Bank Credit was as well current with the State, as with and amongſt the Merchants, otherwiſe it would have happened to them, as with private Caſhiers in this City, where the ſleighting their Bills of Credit, have ever proved fatal to them.</p>
            <p>And therefore if ever His Majeſty deſigns any thing of this nature, He muſt be ſure, that the ſame Credit he would have currently received by others throughout His own Dominions, be made ſo in all publick Receipts and Paiments, which alone would make it current to all; elſe 'tis not to be expected His Majeſty's Credit ſhould paſs, or be ever accepted by any man.</p>
            <p>That all thoſe places where Banks are erected, and Bills of Debt tranſported in Trade, Money is allowed to be brought in, and carried out at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without any loſs or prejudice to Trade: And in truth, 'tis reckon'd in thoſe places no more then a Commodity, riſing and falling in value, as the ſame increaſeth or diminiſheth in quantity, as all other Commodities do.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66157:4"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->
            <p>And whereas it may be thought, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, both in reſpect of the Government, and ſome other accidents frequently objected, is under thoſe Circumſtances, as may render it wholly incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with any thing of this nature, then which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be offered more to the diſgrace of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ſo much admited and celebrated by the greateſt part of mankind, as the beſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It remains to propoſe how, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to reduce it to practiſe in this, as well as in other Countreys.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That certain publick places, called Banks, or Grand Caſh, aſsignable by His Majeſty, in the moſt convenient parts of the Kingdom, be erected, where all Receipts and Payments to and from the Crown, eſpecially exceeding ſuch a ſum, may be reſpectively made.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all perſons receiving Money in Bank, or other aforeſaid Grand Caſh, have liberty indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to aſsign over his or their Credits, where the ſame ſhall be placed, to each mans Account, by way of Debt and Credit, according to what is receiv'd and paid, or carry the ſame away <hi>in Specie,</hi> provided Security be firſt given, to make his or their reſpective Paiments there, for the value re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when ever they have occaſion to deliver it out again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the aforeſaid Credit being made Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in all publick Receipts and Paiments of the Crown, His Majeſty ſhall never be without the Annual Value of His Revenue in Caſh, without
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66157:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->taking up the ſame (as heretofore) on Intereſt, but to imploy and improve to the beſt advantage of the Crown and Kingdom. Or thus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in all caſes of neceſsity, and in defect of money, Tallies be ſtruck in the Exchequer, not exceeding the Annual value of His Majeſties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That there be a certain publick place, where all perſons receiving the ſaid Tallies, may repoſit the ſame under the cuſtody and care of ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Caſhier or Banker, appointed by Authority, who ſhall upon receipt thereof, under the Seal of His Majeſties Exchequer, or ſome other pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Stamp, like thoſe in the <hi>Power</hi> Impreſſed on Money, cauſe the ſame, at the Election of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, to be Coined into ſmall Bills of Credit, as low as 5 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> or under, and delivered out accordingly on demand.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That to the end the ſame may become Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent throughout the whole Kingdom in Trade, it is humbly propoſed, that it may be ordained by His Majeſties Prerogative Royal, or in Parliament. That the ſaid Bills of Credit, thus grounded and ſupported as aforeſaid, ſhall be allowed and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in all publick Receipts and Paiments made to the King, who by thoſe great Sums of Money, giving foundation to the aforeſaid Credit, (being all that while in the Subjects hands) may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Trade and Merchandiſe, to the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible increaſe thereof, and further advance of His Majeſties Revenue.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66157:5"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->
            <p n="7">7. And that I may not be thought to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the notion of a Tally, I conceive all Tallies are delivered out of the Exchequer, upon Receipts of Money paid in, and is in nature of an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Diſcharge for the ſame, in order to their <hi>Quietus.</hi> But in this place, nothing more is meant, then ſome publick <hi>Significavit</hi> from the Crown, that may be reckoned both an Evidence and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in Law, that ſhall accordingly be Current in all publick Receipts and Paiments as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But foraſmuch as ſome part of the ſaid Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Receipts is made to His Majeſty but for term of life, and ſo may be reckoned a Contingency; to the end the aforeſaid Credit may meet with no rub in the courſe of Trade, to the obſtructing His Majeſties more weighty concerns, it is humbly conceived neceſſary, that the ſaid Contingency be provided againſt by His Majeſty in Parliament, or in ſuch other way as to His Majeſty's great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall ſeem beſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Thus the ſaid Authoriſed Bills of Credit ſhall be reckoned a new <hi>Specie</hi> of Money, which His Majeſty creates and ſuperads to the general Stock of the Kingdom, to the great benefit of Trade, which by this means is conſiderably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd and augmented, producing the like effects in the Revenue of the Crown. And it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the general Coin of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and paſs under the name of Check or Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money. Hereby His Majeſty's Security and Pay, without altering any ſetled courſe of His Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66157:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->or incumbring it, may be made as Current and Satisfying as any man's, if not ſuperiour to that of any Prince or State whatſoever, and thereby become. Current in Trade and Commerce, equal to any Coin, the counterfeiting thereof being made in like manner Capital.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That though the ſaid Bills of Credit may be made ſo, as the Bank cannot be deceived, there may be yet ſome difficulty in reference to the Subject, who may not poſsibly be able to diſtinguiſh the true and legitimate Bills from the counterfeit: The beſt way for cure in this caſe is this, after the example of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> eſpecially to write of their reſpective Credits at the Bank. This practiſe duly obſerved, will be of ſingular uſe and advantage to the Crown, and for ought we know, may be equal in value to His Majeſty's Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>As for example, Suppoſe His Majeſty ſhould lend 100 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> or 1000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> upon Security Real or Perſonal; the ſaid perſon by the aforeſaid Rules being obliged, when ever they have occaſion to deliver out this money in paiment to others, to bring it to the Bank, they will chuſe rather to leave it there, where it lies under that Security; ſo transferring it to a Third; he, for the like reaſon, to a Fourth, and ſo to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; whereby the King ſhall receive the Benefit and Intereſt of a hundred times that Sum <hi>per Annum:</hi> mean while the Credit, grounded on the Security onely, is really found, which it ought not to exceed at any time; and though profitable to His Majeſty, as aforeſaid, can be no damage to any man; for if the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66157:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->Security which any man would accept for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney could be made Current, 'tis as good as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This done, it cannot be doubted, but this new <hi>Specie</hi> of money will paſs from the King, where he is immediate Debter, from them again to theirs; and ſo with all perſons concerned in publick Paiments, as Merchants, Brewers, and the like, with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, which will go a great way in Trade, and in effect concludes all. By means whereof, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Land and Naval Forces are accommodated. Nor, by the way, will it be difficult for Sea-men, or other Soldiers, to convert the ſame into money, when tranſmitted to them under theſe circumſtances; for being diſcharged the Publick, they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the ſervice of private Merchants, who at that time Freighting Ships to Sea, have always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Paiments to make to the King; ſeeing it may as well be done in one <hi>Specie</hi> as in another, and being deſired it may at any time be turned into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by Bankers and others, with but ſmall allowance of common Intereſt, foraſmuch as they can imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately paſs the ſame to the Merchants, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king publick Paiments, as aforeſaid, with like allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Intereſt from them, receiving in effect dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Thus the like may be delivered out upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of His Majeſty's Fee-farms, valued at ſo many years purchaſe as they are really worth, or would yield to be ſold, to be allowed and accepted in all publick Paiments to the King, as aforeſaid: mean
